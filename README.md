# Learning to Prune ASPP for Domain-Specific Semantic Segmentation

This repository accompanies the paper:

**"Learning to Prune ASPP for Domain-Specific Semantic Segmentation"**  
submitted to ICPR 2026.

## Overview
This work proposes a learned automatic pruning strategy for the standard ASPP architecture.
By using differentiable branch selection under explicit computational budget constraints,
the method learns domain-specific architectural configurations that improve efficiency
while preserving segmentation accuracy.

## Code Availability
To comply with reproducible research practices, we commit to releasing:

- Full training and evaluation code
- Model configurations and scripts
- Pre-trained models
- Instructions to reproduce the main results reported in the paper

The repository will be fully populated **upon acceptance of the paper**.

## Status
Repository under preparation.  
Code, models, and detailed instructions will be made publicly available after acceptance.

## Contact
For questions, please contact the authors.
